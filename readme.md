# Multi click node

This is a node that takes a button `down` or `up` event, and adds more functionality
to them like double click, press and hold and release events.

## Usage
Enter the string used for down events and up events, and the timeout[ms] to wait for a double-press.

Keep in mind that the higher the timeout, the more latency will be added to your buttons
